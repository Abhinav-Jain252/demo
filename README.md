This is my first Git Repo <br>
Author: Abhinav Jain

1. git clone {https-link}: for cloning git repo to the local machine

2. git status: display the status of the code.

3. 4 type of statuses:
    a. untracked: new file that git doesn't yet tracked.
    b. modified: changed
    c. staged: file is ready to be committed
    d. unmodified: unchanged

4. After a change first we had to <b>Add</b> to make it staged and then perform <b>commit</b> to change the status unchanged.

5. add: adds new or changed file in working directory of the Git staging area
    git add {file name}
    if many changes to commit then simply write: git add .

6. commit: it is the record of change
    git commit -m "some message"
